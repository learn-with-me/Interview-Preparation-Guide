# HR Round Preparation

#### A good company culture?

Think of a racetrack with obstacles. Everyone in the team on the track has a role to play. Some will run to the finish line, some will clear obstacles, some take care of water and nutrition needs, some keep track of time, etc.

Runner needs to have **trust** in person removing the obstacles. Person removing obstacles and person tracking time must be **accountable** for their part of the work. Water team should take **ownership** in identifying needs as when can the water be needed. Overall, for the team to be successful there must be **collaboration** and **team work**.

Along with all this, it is important to see smiling faces, place where new ideas are welcomed, able to have fun with coworkers, and have leaders in the group that you can look up to. In short, a good culture is one that's more than a paycheck for people.

#### Example of taking a tough decision in job?

Leaving my first job. I was overseeing the entire client engagement, working with principle architects, coding, and leading a team of 12 people in different locations. There was not enough learn, nor enough room to grow vertically, however the position was comfortable. At the same time, my presence wouldn't allow junior team members to grow in the team. It was easy to decide to move out, for me to grow and to let others grow as well. On putting down papers, the client offered a job in their company as a Senior Technical Architect within the same team.

This is where it got tough. One side was more money, better benefits, same comfort, I know everyone already. On the other side, everyone would be on the same boat. I'd be doing the same work, and people reporting to me would do the same as well. Hence I chose to quit.

#### Your greatest accomplishment?

Muzaffarnagar is a small place focused on businesses and factories and I wasn't the brightest kid in town back then. As a kid, all I knew was that I loved working with computers, so I got out. 

Talking about work, one of my accomplishments has been, being able to dive in, figure out things. As an example, QA team had a need to automate testing via test scripts before each deploy goes out. This was back in 2008. Each of their script would need about 20 mins execution time. Having no experience in scripting, I had that delivered for the entire project with each script running in 40 seconds.

Other one was setting myself up to be flexible in switching technologies faster and in different areas of applications. I tried learning and remembering it all, however it didn't worked well. Then I started writing GitBook books for making notes. That helped a lot, however that wasn't enough. I finally decided to find a balance between making notes and just focusing on the key concepts to learn, and rely on the internet for syntax and stuff. On the way I realized that there is no true full stack role, it needs to incline in one way or other.

#### Obstacles you had to overcome? Challenging situations?

Let's talk about recent situation. I am leading the entire backend effort at a fast-paced growing startup. As soon as I joined, within few weeks, we had a need to build a new infrastructure in GCP, also no one had access to AWS credentials at that time and no one available to confirm their identity to AWS customer service. This is when I realized, we don't have a devops person. Understanding the sense of time, I started interviewing and hiring freelancers without even knowing completely what I was looking for, and without having to break the bank. 

I decided to take some of the task on my own. Work during the day, learn GCP in the night. Eventually requirements started making sense. I got involved in the Infra architecture. Ended up learning few things about kubernetes and setup couple of "micro-services". This was the time when I was wearing more hats than I saw myself in. Infrastructure, Deployment automation, Node.js application, Python-Flask API, mentoring out-of-college graduate, working with multiple consultants, kicked off an initiative on corporate security and actively interviewing people, etc.

#### What kind of culture you're looking for?

* Are the employees open and personable, or are they often focused on their work and work is their life?
* Do the leaders lead by example? Do you have visibility to them? Is there an open door policy?
* Is there a long process for approval, or as long as you complete your work efficiently, you can do it however you'd like?

#### Responsibilities on a day-to-day basis?
