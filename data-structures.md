# Data Structures

A data structure is a way of organizing the data so that the data can be used efficiently. Different kinds of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. For example, B-trees are particularly well-suited for implementation of databases, while compiler implementations usually use hash tables to look up identifiers.

##### What are linear and non linear data Structures?

* **Linear:** A data structure is said to be linear if its elements form a sequence or a linear list. Examples: Array. Linked List, Stacks and Queues
* **Non-Linear:** A data structure is said to be non-linear if traversal of nodes is nonlinear in nature. Example: Graph and Trees.
